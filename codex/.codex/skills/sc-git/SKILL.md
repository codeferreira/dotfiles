## A. Skill Invocation
- This skill is invoked by mentioning `$sc-git`.
- Treat all user text after `$sc-git` as `{{SC_ARGS}}`.
- If no arguments are present, treat `{{SC_ARGS}}` as empty.

## B. Claude Command Translation
- This skill is a Codex-native port of the Claude command tree and SuperClaude framework.
- Translate Claude `spawn_agent(...)` patterns to Codex `spawn_agent(...)`.
- Translate Claude planning/checklist language to Codex `update_plan`.
- Prefer existing Codex MCP servers from `config.toml` when the original command mentions MCP.

## C. Compatibility Notes
- Original command: `git`.
- Codex invocation: `$sc-git`.
- Preserve the behavioral intent of the source command, but use Codex-native tools and collaboration primitives.

# $sc-git - Git Operations

## Triggers
- Git repository operations: status, add, commit, push, pull, branch
- Need for intelligent commit message generation
- Repository workflow optimization requests
- Branch management and merge operations

## Usage
```
$sc-git [operation] [args] [--smart-commit] [--interactive]
```

## Behavioral Flow
1. **Analyze**: Check repository state and working directory changes
2. **Validate**: Ensure operation is appropriate for current Git context
3. **Execute**: Run Git command with intelligent automation
4. **Optimize**: Apply smart commit messages and workflow patterns
5. **Report**: Provide status and next steps guidance

Key behaviors:
- Generate conventional commit messages based on change analysis
- Apply consistent branch naming conventions
- Handle merge conflicts with guided resolution
- Provide clear status summaries and workflow recommendations

## Tool Coordination
- **Bash**: Git command execution and repository operations
- **Read**: Repository state analysis and configuration review
- **Grep**: Log parsing and status analysis
- **Write**: Commit message generation and documentation

## Key Patterns
- **Smart Commits**: Analyze changes → generate conventional commit message
- **Status Analysis**: Repository state → actionable recommendations
- **Branch Strategy**: Consistent naming and workflow enforcement
- **Error Recovery**: Conflict resolution and state restoration guidance

## Examples

### Smart Status Analysis
```
$sc-git status
# Analyzes repository state with change summary
# Provides next steps and workflow recommendations
```

### Intelligent Commit
```
$sc-git commit --smart-commit
# Generates conventional commit message from change analysis
# Applies best practices and consistent formatting
```

### Interactive Operations
```
$sc-git merge feature-branch --interactive
# Guided merge with conflict resolution assistance
```

## Boundaries

**Will:**
- Execute Git operations with intelligent automation
- Generate conventional commit messages from change analysis
- Provide workflow optimization and best practice guidance

**Will Not:**
- Modify repository configuration without explicit authorization
- Execute destructive operations without confirmation
- Handle complex merges requiring manual intervention
